# FR24 ADS-B Redesign
Welcome to our exciting project aimed at enhancing the user experience for FR24 Feeder users who share their ADS-B data with FlightRadar24. Our mission is to transform the existing FR24 web interface, which is currently limited in information and aesthetics. By modernizing the web interface and providing a richer display of real-time data for tracked planes in your area, we are committed to delivering a more immersive and informative aviation experience.
<br>
If you're running the FR24 Feeder on a Raspberry Pi and contributing your ADS-B data to FlightRadar24, our project offers a fresh and improved approach to the real-time data website. We're dedicated to making plane tracking more engaging and informative for aviation enthusiasts and users alike.

If you have FR24 Feeder on a raspberry pi and you are sharing your ADS-B data with FlightRadar24, this project just redesigns the realtime data website.
